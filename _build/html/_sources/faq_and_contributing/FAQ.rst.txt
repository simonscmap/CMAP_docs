FAQ
===

|

What do the |colab| and |binder| badges do?
--------------------------------------------------------------

Google Colab and Binder are projects that allow you to run code on the cloud without downloading or installing anything on your computer.
Simons CMAP has Colab and Binder badges, which allow you to run any of the pycmap examples simply by clicking on the badges.

Google Colab seems to start faster, but currently requires you to uncomment (ie. remove the '#') to install pycmap.
Binder takes a little longer to start, but may be easier to use.
Feel free to try one or both!

.. note::
  Binder and Colab are great for learning and testing, but if you have a longer term project using pycmap we strongly suggest installing pycmap locally.
  Please save any work you wish to keep locally, as Binder and Colab are temporary instances and will not save any of your work.


What is an API Key and how do I get one?
----------------------------------------

An API key is a unique identifier required to run all software packages. To obtain an API key, please register_ first and then go to https://simonscmap.com/apikeymanagement.
Please keep this key for future use. All projects developed by Simons CMAP team are open-source and can be found on Github_.

**Please do not share API keys.**



What is a DOI and how do I get one for my dataset?
--------------------------------------------------

A DOI or Digital Object Identifier is a digital identifier for a dataset.
It allows for users to cite the use of a dataset and properly acknowledge the dataset creators.
Some DOI providers, such as Zenodo, allow for dataset version controlling.

We strongly suggest getting a DOI for your dataset prior to it's submission into CMAP. This will allow users to properly acknowledge your dataset.

Below is an example list of entities that may issue and link your dataset to a unique DOI:

  - Zenodo_
  - Dryad_ (only accepts published datsets)
  - FigShare_
  - Open_Science_Framework_
  - Harvard_Dataverse_
  - NCEI_
  - ORNL_DAAC_
  - EDI_
  - PANGAEA_
  - SEANOE_
  - NASA_Goddard_
  - NERC_
